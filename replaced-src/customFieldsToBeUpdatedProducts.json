The arms are made from 3/16\" steel that is precision laser cut, formed and fully welded. Preinstalled MOOG brand ball joints and rubber bushings provide an easy installation and long service life. The ball joint is repositioned to compensate for the added lift and maintain a neutral position at ride height. To complement the improved upper ball joint angles, the kit address the other area often ignored at this lift height - the CV shafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Adventure Series kit for the 01-10 HDs includes a full differential drop system that relocates the differential down 2\" for near stock angles at the 3\" lift height. This is accomplished with a drop spacer on the passenger's side, (2) drop brackets for the front driver's mount and a integrated \"half crossmember\" for the driver's rear mount. A new different skid plate is included to protect the differential in its new position. The rear is lifted via a 2\" block and u-bolts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Front and rear shocks are upgraded Nitro versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">Featured Technology &amp; Benefits</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fully welded, heavy duty upper control arms that dwarf the factory arms.</li>\r\n<li>Preinstalled replaceable MOOG brand ball joints and rubber bushings.</li>\r\n<li>Reposititioned ball joints to maintain a nuetral angle with added lift.</li>\r\n<li>Full differential drop system included to maintain proper CV shaft angles.</li>\r\n<li>Differential skid plate included.</li>\r\n<li>Rear height is adjusted with 2\" blocks.</li>\t\t\t\t   \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">Important Notes!</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b><i>*Kit images show upgraded Nitro (black) shocks*</i></b></li>\r\n<li>Frame bracket mount modification required</li>\r\n<li>Torsion bar unloading/loading tool required</li>\r\n<li>Will not fit dually models</li>\r\n<li>To determine which kit # is required, verify which RPO codes are shown in the glovebox to determine the factory installed torsion keys.

The faster you can keep the velocity of the gas, the easier it is to spool the turbocharger. Thermal barriers play a part in this as well. Due to the material having a high ability to retain heat, the heat remains inside the manifold instead of being expelled. The hot exhaust gasses are still expanding as they exit the engine, and it is ideal to get those gasses into the turbocharger while theyre still expanding as this will create more action on the turbine wheel & result in a faster spool-up. This is one huge advantage to using a set of well-engineered exhaust manifolds over headers, which increase the time it takes the exhaust to reach the turbocharger due to the extra length added to the tubes in order to create equal-length pipes; the result of is the gasses are cooling and therefore contracting by the time they reach the turbine wheel, reducing the action created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"../images/pdf/ATS_Duramax_Manifold_Install.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Installation\r\nInstructions</a> <img src=\"/images/design/pdf_logo_sm.jpg\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\" border=\"0\"></p>",

With the new designed valve bodies achieving the higher pressures, a BD PressureLoc is no longer needed when an exhaust brake is installed to assist in preventing convertor lock up clutch slippage &ndash; this unit does it all! (BD still recommends the use of a PressureLoc for transmissions not equipped with one of our new designed valve bodies when an exhaust brake is installed.)</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">We also added second gear lock-up capability that with the addition of one of our TorqLoc or TowLoc kits can offer serious engine retarding capability on towing applications.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">Each valve body is tested to ensure proper function before shipping.

Results in torque and power gains across the full operating rpm range, starting right off idle and marching to the shift point in each gear. Derringer is dyno calibrated to use multiple data inputs such as throttle position, rpm, vehicle speed, AFR, Knock and coolant temperature, just like your engine's ECU. Its microprocessor-based electronics are able to actively and safely optimize calibrations in real time. No competitive product does that.</p>\r\n<p>Derringer has six switched settings. Level 6 produces Best in Class performance and knocks you back in your seat. The Level 3 setting is for work use and has a great mid-range feel. When running Level 3 with a loaded work truck and/or pulling a trailer, your on-ramp merging speeds and passing times are greatly improved.</p>\r\n<p>The electronics are enclosed in a compact housing which is easily concealed and communicates using B-Bus (Banks Bus) with other devices such as our iDash 1.8 DataMonster® or iDash® 1.8 Super Gauge. The Derringer connects in line with your truck's engine sensors. But, unlike others, it also connects to the vehicle's OBDII diagnostic bus connector. A CAN (Controller Area Network) transceiver chip communicates with OBDII or B-Bus allowing our microprocessor to talk with the vehicle. And, Derringer's special coolant temp watchdog prevents power addition when the engine is too cold or overheated. The Derringer also auto-adjusts power if knock occurs due to bad fuel. Maximum safe power is all automatic with a Derringer - you just choose your setting.</p><ul><li>Simple plug and play installation with easy removal for dealer service</li><li>Warranty friendly: no reflash required and no traces left in ECU</li>\r\n  <li>Adds up to 72 hp and 148 lb-ft (2011-2014)</li>\r\n  <li>Adds up to 61 hp and 120 lb-ft (2015-2016)</li>\r\n  <li>Adds up to 59 hp and 106 lb-ft (2017-2019)</li>\r\n<li>Loaded with Features</li><li>Value Priced</li><li>Destroys the competition, not your vehicle!</li><li>ActiveSafety protects engine/powertrain</li><li>6 power levels with on the fly level changing</li><li>Interfaces with OBDII Port (On-Board Diagnostics/Information) to communicate directly with the vehicle ECU</li><li>Adds Data-Logging functionality (incl 8gb micro-SD)</li><li>Log up 100 parameters at a time</li><li>Log up to 20 min/max values</li><li>Enclosed in a compact housing which is easily concealed</li><li>LED Derringer status indicator</li><li>Works while in cruise control</li><li>Optimized Derringer layout to view vital data</li><li>Regen status displayed over power level when Regen is active</li><li>Power added bar graph shows Derringer power being added</li><li>On-screen Derringer Status Indicator</li><li>Datalog up to 100 Derringer, engine or transmission parameters through microSD card</li><li>Corrects MAP and FRP parameter to accurate readings</li><li>Update Derringer software and calibration through iDash 1.8 using microSD card</li><li>Expand system with other Banks Bus products<ul><li>Ambient Air Density Module</li><li>4-CH Analog Sensor Module*</li><li>4-CH Thermocouple Module*</li><li>Advanced Water Methanol Module*</li><li>More coming soon</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Emissions Compliant:</strong>&nbsp;In Process</p><p><strong>US Patent # 7,593,808 &amp; # 7,254,477</strong></p><hr><h4>The Banks difference when it comes to the 6.7L POWER Stroke!</h4> \r\n<p>The Derringer tuner — When it comes down to it, you want a real 6.7L Power Stroke tuner.

Fortunately, we’ve been making&nbsp;tuners&nbsp;for 20 years, so we know what we’re doing.</p> \r\n<p> The Derringer is a plug-and-play microcomputer designed for easy installation, it’s enclosed in a compact housing which is easily concealed, and connects to the iDash 1.8 Super Gauge for the ultimate in information and power selection, unlocking three additional power levels.</p> \r\n<p> <strong> AutoRate® </strong> &nbsp;</p> \r\n<p> Unlike the fixed tuning used by others, the Derringer calibration is continuously adjusting to provide you the peak possible performance under every driving condition.

During warmup, no power is added below 120° F, then power is ramped in and fully available above 150° If the coolant overheats for any reason, the Derringer starts removing its power at 230° F and additional power is totally removed if you exceed 240° F. </li> \r\n  <li> Full Power Timer – If set on Sport level, the Derringer allows for 30 seconds of wide open throttle before transitioning to the recommended power level for sustained tow/haul.

The system constantly monitors various parameters at over 50 times a second to ensure that everything is operating as it should. If any competitive tuners lose power or fail in any way, they will instantly trigger a “limp home” mode where all power is lost and the vehicle dangerously slows to a crawl.

    "replacedDesc": "<div class=\"QuickTitle\">Derringer Tuner with iDash 1.8 Super Gauge with ActiveSafety - 2011-2019 Ford F250-F550</div>\r\n<p>Part # 66693</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stops the competition dead in their tracks. Results in torque and power gains across the full operating rpm range, starting right off idle and marching to the shift point in each gear. Derringer is dyno calibrated to use multiple data inputs such as throttle position, rpm, vehicle speed, AFR, Knock and coolant temperature, just like your engine's ECU. Its microprocessor based electronics are able to actively and safely optimize calibrations in real time. No competitive product does that.</p>\r\n<p>Derringer has six switched settings. Level 6 produces Best in Class performance and knocks you back in your seat. The Level 3 setting is for work use and has great mid-range feel. When running Level 3 with a loaded work truck and/or pulling a trailer, your on ramp merging speeds and passing times are greatly improved.</p>\r\n<p>The electronics are enclosed in a compact housing which is easily concealed and communicates using B-Bus (Banks Bus) with other devices such as our iDash 1.8&nbsp;DataMonster® or iDash® 1.8 Super Gauge. The Derringer connects in line with your truck's engine sensors. But, unlike others it also connects to the vehicle's OBDII diagnostic bus connector. A CAN (Controller Area Network) transceiver chip communicates with OBDII or B-Bus allowing our microprocessor to talk with the vehicle. And, Derringer's special coolant temp watchdog prevents power addition when the engine is too cold or overheated. The Derringer also auto-adjusts power if knock occurs due to bad fuel. Maximum safe power is all automatic with a Derringer - you just choose your setting.</p><ul><li>Simple plug and play installation with easy removal for dealer service</li><li>Warranty friendly: no reflash required and no traces left in ECU</li>\r\n  <li>Adds up to 72 hp and 148 lb-ft (2011-2014)</li>\r\n  <li>Adds up to 61 hp and 120 lb-ft (2015-2016)</li>\r\n  <li>Adds up to 59 hp and 106 lb-ft (2017-2019)</li>\r\n<li>Loaded with Features</li><li>Value Priced</li><li>Destroys the competition, not your vehicle!</li><li>ActiveSafety protects engine/powertrain</li><li>6 power levels with on the fly level changing</li><li>Interfaces with OBDII Port (On-Board Diagnostics/Information) to communicate directly with the vehicle ECU</li><li>Log up to 20 min/max values</li><li>Enclosed in a compact housing which is easily concealed</li><li>LED Derringer status indicator</li><li>Works while in cruise control</li><li>Optimized Derringer layout to view vital data</li><li>Regen status displayed over power level when Regen is active</li><li>Power added bar graph shows Derringer power being added</li><li>On-screen Derringer Status Indicator</li><li>Corrects MAP and FRP parameter to accurate readings</li><li>Update Derringer software and calibration through iDash 1.8 using microSD card</li><li>Expand system with other Banks Bus products<ul><li>Ambient Air Density Module</li><li>4-CH Analog Sensor Module*</li><li>4-CH Thermocouple Module*</li><li>Advanced Water Methanol Module*</li><li>More coming soon</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Emissions Compliant:</strong>&nbsp;In Process</p><p><strong>US Patent # 7,593,808 &amp; # 7,254,477</strong></p><hr><h4>The Banks difference when it comes to the 6.7L POWER Stroke!</h4> \r\n<p>The Derringer tuner — When it comes down to it, you want a real 6.7L Power Stroke tuner.

The Mishimoto 6.0L Powerstroke intercooler is manufactured with heavy-duty cast aluminum end tanks and a stout bar-and-plate core, designed to decrease intake temperatures, improve airflow, and reduce pressure drop. By decreasing pressure drop this intercooler will extend the life of your turbocharger and improve the efficiency of your Powerstroke. The Mishimoto Powerstroke intercooler features a core with greater volume than the factory cooler; this results in numerous performance benefits including increased pressure tolerance and lower EGTs.

The solution is finally here! Mishimoto is proud to expand their line of Duramax performance parts to include the 2011-2016 Chevrolet/GMC 6.6L Duramax LML Intercooler Kit! This Duramax performance parts kit includes everything you need to improve airflow, substantially decrease air-charge temperatures, and support your truck at any power level. The Mishimoto Duramax intercooler piping kit is the first key component; our engineers have maximized airflow by eliminating restrictive bends, allowing for a smooth and unimpeded airflow. The piping is constructed with mandrel-bent aluminum polished to a flawless finish. <br><br>This Duramax intercooler kit includes Mishimoto silicone boots with DuraCore™ technology and Constant-Tension T-Bolt Clamps for accurate and consistent holding power. Mishimoto DuraCore™ technology is the synthetic material that comprises the innermost layer of all Mishimoto silicone diesel boots. Compared to normal silicone, DuraCore™ provides superior resistance to heat, pressure, fuel, and oil. This effectively increases the life of our boots by preventing leaks and blowouts. <br><br>This package is rounded out with the Mishimoto Duramax 6.6L intercooler which features cast aluminum end tanks and a bar-and-plate core, all designed to provide cool, dense air to your engine. The Mishimoto Duramax intercooler features a 101% increase in core volume and is 73% thicker compared to the factory cooler, allowing for cooler intake temperatures, lower EGTs, and increased boost pressure tolerance. <br><br>All the components in this kit are engineered to last, just like your truck. Offered with either a Sleek Silver or Stealth Black intercooler, the Mishimoto 6.6L Duramax LML Intercooler Kit, like all of our Duramax performance parts, is protected by our signature Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">Features:</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Direct fit for 2011–2016 Chevrolet/GMC 6.6L Duramax LML</li>\r\n<li>Includes hot-side and

The solution is finally here! Mishimoto is proud to expand their line of Duramax performance parts to include the 2011-2016 Chevrolet/GMC 6.6L Duramax LML Intercooler Kit! This Duramax performance parts kit includes everything you need to improve airflow, substantially decrease air-charge temperatures, and support your truck at any power level. The Mishimoto Duramax intercooler piping kit is the first key component; our engineers have maximized airflow by eliminating restrictive bends, allowing for a smooth and unimpeded airflow. The piping is constructed with mandrel-bent aluminum polished to a flawless finish. <br><br>This Duramax intercooler kit includes Mishimoto silicone boots with DuraCore™ technology and Constant-Tension T-Bolt Clamps for accurate and consistent holding power. Mishimoto DuraCore™ technology is the synthetic material that comprises the innermost layer of all Mishimoto silicone diesel boots. Compared to normal silicone, DuraCore™ provides superior resistance to heat, pressure, fuel, and oil. This effectively increases the life of our boots by preventing leaks and blowouts. <br><br>This package is rounded out with the Mishimoto Duramax 6.6L intercooler which features cast aluminum end tanks and a bar-and-plate core, all designed to provide cool, dense air to your engine. The Mishimoto Duramax intercooler features a 101% increase in core volume and is 73% thicker compared to the factory cooler, allowing for cooler intake temperatures, lower EGTs, and increased boost pressure tolerance. <br><br>All the components in this kit are engineered to last, just like your truck. Offered with either a Sleek Silver or Stealth Black intercooler, the Mishimoto 6.6L Duramax LML Intercooler Kit, like all of our Duramax performance parts, is protected by our signature Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">Features:</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Direct fit for 2011–2016 Chevrolet/GMC 6.6L Duramax LML</li>\r\n<li>Includes hot-side and

The solution is finally here! Mishimoto is proud to expand their line of Duramax performance parts to include the 2011-2016 Chevrolet/GMC 6.6L Duramax LML Intercooler Kit! This Duramax performance parts kit includes everything you need to improve airflow, substantially decrease air-charge temperatures, and support your truck at any power level. The Mishimoto Duramax intercooler piping kit is the first key component; our engineers have maximized airflow by eliminating restrictive bends, allowing for a smooth and unimpeded airflow. The piping is constructed with mandrel-bent aluminum polished to a flawless finish. <br><br>This Duramax intercooler kit includes Mishimoto silicone boots with DuraCore™ technology and Constant-Tension T-Bolt Clamps for accurate and consistent holding power. Mishimoto DuraCore™ technology is the synthetic material that comprises the innermost layer of all Mishimoto silicone diesel boots. Compared to normal silicone, DuraCore™ provides superior resistance to heat, pressure, fuel, and oil. This effectively increases the life of our boots by preventing leaks and blowouts. <br><br>This package is rounded out with the Mishimoto Duramax 6.6L intercooler which features cast aluminum end tanks and a bar-and-plate core, all designed to provide cool, dense air to your engine. The Mishimoto Duramax intercooler features a 101% increase in core volume and is 73% thicker compared to the factory cooler, allowing for cooler intake temperatures, lower EGTs, and increased boost pressure tolerance. <br><br>All the components in this kit are engineered to last, just like your truck. Offered with either a Sleek Silver or Stealth Black intercooler, the Mishimoto 6.6L Duramax LML Intercooler Kit, like all of our Duramax performance parts, is protected by our signature Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty.</p>\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\">Features:</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Direct fit for 2011–2016 Chevrolet/GMC 6.6L Duramax LML</li>\r\n<li>Includes hot-side and

This kit includes everything you need to improve airflow, substantially lower air charge temperatures, reduce EGTs, and support your truck at any power level. The first key component is the Mishimoto intercooler piping; our engineers have maximized airflow by eliminating restrictive bends, allowing for a smooth and unimpeded airflow. The pipes are constructed of mandrel bent aluminum polished to a mirror finish. This kit includes Mishimoto silicone boots with DuraCore™ technology and constant-tension T-bolt clamps for accurate and consistent holding power. Mishimoto DuraCore™ technology is the synthetic material that comprises the innermost layer of all Mishimoto silicone diesel boots.  Compared to normal silicone, DuraCore™ provides superior resistance to heat, pressure, fuel, and oil. This effectively increases the life of our boots by preventing leaks and blowouts. This package is rounded out with the Mishimoto intercooler, featuring a significant increase in core volume, extremely durable cast aluminum end tanks, and a bar-and-plate core, all designed to provide cool, dense air to your engine. Our intercooler reduces pressure drop, which results in an overall increase in engine efficiency. All the components in this kit are engineered to last, just like your truck. The Mishimoto 6.0L Powerstroke intercooler kit is protected by our signature lifetime warranty.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"mishivid\" style=\"padding-bottom:12px;\">\r\n<iframe width=\"720\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9nbbqGXhxo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"33%\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n<td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"/files/products/MSH/mmint-f2d-03k-specs-432x528.jpg\" width=\"432\" height=\"528\" Border=\"0\" Alt=\"Mishimoo MMINT-F2D-03K Product Specs\"></td>\r\n<td width=\"33%\">&nbsp;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<div class=\"QuickTitle\"><font color=\"white\">&nbsp;Installation Video:</font></div>\r\n<iframe width=\"720\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8lgB8nQJT0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div>",

This kit includes everything you need to improve airflow, substantially decrease air-charge temperatures, reduce EGTs, and support your truck at any power level. The first key component is the Mishimoto intercooler piping. Our engineers have maximized airflow by eliminating restrictive bends, allowing for a smooth and unimpeded airflow. This piping is constructed of mandrel bent 3.5” aluminum with a polished finish. This kit includes Mishimoto silicone boots with DuraCore™ technology and constant-tension T-bolt clamps for accurate and consistent holding force. Mishimoto DuraCore™ technology is the synthetic material that comprises the innermost layer of all Mishimoto silicone diesel boots.  Compared to normal silicone, DuraCore™ provides superior resistance to heat, pressure, fuel, and oil. This effectively increases the life of our boots by preventing leaks and blowouts. This package is rounded out with the Mishimoto intercooler featuring extremely durable cast aluminum end tanks and a bar-and-plate core, all designed to provide cool, dense air to your engine. The Mishimoto Cummins intercooler features a core volume significantly greater than factory units, which allows for improved cooling and power.
